        <!-- id:1 Pancake ingredients & instructions lists-->
        <ul class="breakfast" id="pancake-ingredients">
            <li>2 cups spelt flour (light or sprouted spelt flour will work)</li>
            <li>4 teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon organic cane sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>3 teaspoon arrowroot powder (optional substitutes - cornstarch or an egg replacer powder (1:1 ratio))</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups unsweetened almond milk (or non-dairy milk of choice)</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil (optional alternative cooking oils)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <ol class="breakfast" id="pancake-instructions">
            <li>In a medium bowl, sift together the spelt flour, baking powder, cane sugar, cinnamon and sea salt and arrowroot powder. Make a well in the center of the mixture.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the almond milk, oil and vanilla. Pour the mixture into the well of the flour mixture and stir just until moistened; be sure not to over mix. Let the batter sit for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Drop approx ⅓ cup of batter onto the hot pan and shape into a rough circle using the back of a spoon. Drop more batter as you pan size will allow.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat until the edges start to turn brown and the tops form bubbles. Flip and cook until golden brown (about 3-5 minutes a side). Serve warm with fresh fruit and maple syrup.</li>
        </ol>

         <!-- id:2 Egg ingredients & instructions lists-->
         <ul class="breakfast" id="egg-ingredients">
            <li>1/2 cup chickpea flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kala namak (Indian black salt, for “eggy” flavor)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil, for cooking</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, as desired</li>
        </ul> 

        <ol class="breakfast" id="egg-instructions">
            <li>Add all of the ingredients except for the black salt to a medium sized bowl and whisk until smooth. </li>
            <li>Add more chickpea flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed to thicken. The mixture should be the consistency of a pancake batter.</li>
            <li>Heat a medium nonstick pan over medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil (recommended). Once warmed, add in the batter.</li>
            <li>Cook, mixing often, until the mixture reaches the consistency of scrambled eggs, about 4-6 minutes. It will seem like it is too wet at first but if you keep cooking it, it will eventually dry out into the scramble consistency.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We suggest when you mix it, to press it down into a thin layer so that it all cooks evenly. If it piles up into a “ball of dough”, it will not cook all the way through.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Sprinkle in the black salt and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, serve warm and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
