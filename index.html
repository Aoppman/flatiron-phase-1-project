        <ul class="breakfast" id="pancake-ingredients">
            <li>2 cups spelt flour (light or sprouted spelt flour will work)</li>
            <li>4 teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon organic cane sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>3 teaspoon arrowroot powder (optional substitutes - cornstarch or an egg replacer powder (1:1 ratio))</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups unsweetened almond milk (or non-dairy milk of choice)</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil (optional alternative cooking oils)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <ol class="breakfast" id="pancake-instructions">
            <li>In a medium bowl, sift together the spelt flour, baking powder, cane sugar, cinnamon and sea salt and aroowroot powder. Make a well in the center of the mixture.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the almond milk, oil and vanilla. Pour the mixture into the well of the flour mixture and stir just until moistened; be sure not to over mix. Let the batter sit for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Drop approx ⅓ cup of batter onto the hot pan and shape into a rough circle using the back of a spoon. Drop more batter as you pan size will allow.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat until the edges start to turn brown and the tops form bubbles. Flip and cook until golden brown (about 3-5 minutes a side). Serve warm with fresh fruit and maple syrup.</li>
