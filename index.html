    <!-- id:1 Pancake ingredients & instructions lists-->
    <ul class="breakfast" id="pancake-ingredients">
      <li>2 cups spelt flour (light or sprouted spelt flour will work)</li>
      <li>4 teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon organic cane sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon sea salt</li>
      <li>
        3 teaspoon arrowroot powder (optional substitutes - cornstarch or an egg
        replacer powder (1:1 ratio))
      </li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups unsweetened almond milk (or non-dairy milk of choice)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil (optional alternative cooking oils)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <ol class="breakfast" id="pancake-instructions">
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, sift together the spelt flour, baking powder, cane
        sugar, cinnamon and sea salt and arrowroot powder. Make a well in the
        center of the mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk together the almond milk, oil and vanilla. Pour
        the mixture into the well of the flour mixture and stir just until
        moistened; be sure not to over mix. Let the batter sit for about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Drop approx 1/3
        cup of batter onto the hot pan and shape into a rough circle using the
        back of a spoon. Drop more batter as you pan size will allow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook over medium heat until the edges start to turn brown and the tops
        form bubbles. Flip and cook until golden brown (about 3-5 minutes a
        side). Serve warm with fresh fruit and maple syrup.
      </li>

    <div class="breakfast" id="egg">
    <!-- id:2 Egg ingredients & instructions lists-->
    <ul class="breakfast" id="egg-ingredients">
      <li>1/2 cup chickpea flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kala namak (Indian black salt, for -eggy- flavor)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oil, for cooking</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper, as desired</li>
    </ul>

    <ol class="breakfast" id="egg-instructions">
      <li>
        Add all of the ingredients except for the black salt to a medium sized
        bowl and whisk until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add more chickpea flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed to thicken.
        The mixture should be the consistency of a pancake batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a medium nonstick pan over medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil
        (recommended). Once warmed, add in the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook, mixing often, until the mixture reaches the consistency of
        scrambled eggs, about 4-6 minutes. It will seem like it is too wet at
        first but if you keep cooking it, it will eventually dry out into the
        scramble consistency.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We suggest when you mix it, to press it down into a thin layer so that
          it all cooks evenly. If it piles up into a -ball of dough-, it will
          not cook all the way through.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Sprinkle in the black salt and season with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from heat, serve warm and enjoy!</li>

        In a large bowl, add the flour and all the spices. Mix together until

      <li>
        In a second bowl, add 1/3 cup of the flour mixture with 3/4 cups of
        water. Whisk together until to achieve a smooth batter consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip each mushroom into the wet batter mixture then into the flour
        mixture. Double coat each mushroom back into the wet batter and then
        back in the flour mixture, making sure the mushrooms are fully coated in
        flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a pot over high heat and carefully drop mushrooms into the
        oil one at a time in batches.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Don't overcrowd the pot, you can fry a few at a time depending how
          large your pot is. Let them fry for a few minutes until nice and
          golden on all sides.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Remove and place on paper towels to remove excess oil, then place on a
        cooling rack to keep crispy until the rest is done. Enjoy with your
        favourite dipping sauce or make a delicious vegan "chicken" sandwich
