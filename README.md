My Flatiron Frontend Phase 1 Project

"Try Vegan!"


To begin your journey to my website, first you must start the JSON server.

To do so you can start by typing "json-server --watch db.json" into the console. 

This will initiate a GET request and fetch the JSON data, the console should then return a "successful" GET response in the console with a corresponding number ranging from 200-300. 

The console will also provide the "localhost" URL in which you can copy and paste into the browser. This produce the JSON object data that will be parsed behind the scenes, rendering the final product that we all know and call a "webpage".

After the JSON server has completed the GET request successfully, in a new or alternate terminal window/tab you will run "open index.html" (on Mac) or "explorer.exe index.html" (on Windows).

This will launch the HTML file in your web browser for viewing.
In this HTML file are linked resources such as an "index.js" file and a "Stylesheet.css" files. These files will provide code and styling to the basics of the HTML, and produce the final product.


Navigating the environment

When the webpage loads you will be greeted with some colorful images and a basic question. -

"Would you try a vegan take on some of your everyday favorite foods?"

If you are daring enough, you can:

- Select one of the three meal categories from the drop down menu present. 
 (in doing so you will be prompted by an alert verifying your selection)

- Once the "ok" button is clicked, the alert will cease

- At this time, two delicious vegan alternatives of staple and heart warming meals will be generated before your eyes.

* consisting of 
- A meal title
- A delicious meal visual 
- A main website link (with theoption to visit the main site to view other available vegan meal creations)
- A button labeled "Ingredients & Instructions" that, in a new 'tab', will open to the direct link for that specific meal recipe and cooking instructions

In hopes of trying something new, enjoy a wonderful vegan alternative to a few "breakfast", "lunch" & "dinner" classics, on the house. ðŸ˜‹
